## FAQ
**Do I need calculus to use vectors in data science?**  
No. Start with vectors as ‘rows of numbers’ and learn operations step by step.

**What is a feature?**  
A feature is a column in your spreadsheet (like age or emails opened).

**What is a model?**  
A model is a formula that uses features to make a guess about an outcome.

**What does ‘conversion’ mean here?**  
It means a customer purchased after receiving an email or ad.

**What does ‘churn’ mean here?**
